# All Ears — Real World Vision

> Discovery doesn't just stay digital; it guides you out into the world to experience it.

## The Idea

We could imagine an app that starts with your favorite artist and builds a dynamic "family tree" of their influences—pulling from real-world history, interviews, and genres.

It could link you to:
- **Live shows** — concerts, festivals, local gigs
- **Vinyl stores** — nearby record shops with relevant inventory
- **Local scenes** — venues, communities, and events tied to the genres you're exploring

So discovery doesn't just stay digital; it guides you out into the world to experience it.

**A real-life musical journey.**
